Installation of SALDI
================================================= ===========================

System requirements for server:
----------------------
Linux or other Unix-like system with web server with PHP support
as well as a PostgreSQL or MySQLi/MariaDB database server. PostgreSQL is recommended
as a database server.

In newer versions of PostgreSQL, the database administrator must have the right
'trust', which is set in the configuration file pg_hba.conf, for example as follows:

 local all postgres trust

If it is not set, there may be problems with loading the security
copy.

It is not recommended to use other database servers, as it is likely that there
errors will occur when upgrading where there has been a change in the database model.

System requirements for client:
----------------------
Web browser where cookies and JavaScript are enabled and which supports new ones
windows and pop-ups.

Saldi is developed for and tested with the web browsers:
- Google Chrome / Chromium
- Vivaldi

Browsers from Microsoft are generally buggy and not recommended


The installation itself:
---------------------
0. We assume you have already initialized git. Then, Clone it from github to your root directory without adding in into extra directory.

e.g www/  

www$ clone https://github.com/DANOSOFT/saldi.git

or www/html/

www/html$ git clone https://github.com/DANOSOFT/saldi.git

Note: if you don't need the extra directory that comes with the clonning, 
i.) 
Go to your working directory and run these commands:
	$ git remote add origin https://github.com/DANOSOFT/saldi.git
	$ git fetch origin
	$ git checkout -t origin/master



1. If necessary, create the group balances:

 sudo groupadd balances

2. Optionally add the web user www-data to the balances group.

 sudo sed -i 's/^\(balances:.*[a-z0-9]\)$/\1,www-data/' /etc/group
 sudo sed -i 's/^\(balances:.*\\)$/\1www-data/' /etc/group
 
3. Manually create these directories inside the root of saldi: 'temp' and 'logolib'.
e.g saldi/loglib etc.

4. Change the rights to the 'includes', 'logolib' and 'temp' directories, so
 the web server user (the visitor) has access to write in
 these. If this user on the system is called www-data and is a member of
 the group balances then:

 sudo chgrp -R balances /var/www/html/saldi/
 sudo chmod 775 /var/www/html/saldi/{includes,logolib,temp}

 or if you are down in the Saldi catalog itself:

 sudo chmod 775 includes logolib temp
 
 If that permission didn't work during installation, you can use 777. 

 In the includes directory the file connect.php is created, so after
 creation, it can be changed to 555. In the catalog logolib
 are logos that are put up placed, while that too
 can be changed to 555 if you do not have (multiple) logos,
 which must be posted. However, it is important that there is write access
 to the temp directory as this is where log files and backups are
 is printed out.

5. Make sure that both the web server and the database server are running. Look in
 the documentation for these to see how.

6. Open your browser.

7. Specify the address of the web server and the directory under the web server
 hierarchy where you copied the Balances files to. For example:
 
	#domain/saldi

       # http://localhost/saldi 

8. It may be that the browser complains that the page is trying to
 open pop-up windows. You must accept this. If not, it takes you to the installation page.

9. In the newly opened popup window, select database server and character set as well
 database administrator, password for this, username are specified
 and password for the Balances administrator. There is instruction text
 at each point that pops up when the cursor is moved over the field.
 both the database and the database's administrator and acceptor.

 Click the Install button when you have filled in all the fields.

10. Then Saldi is installed, which can be seen from the header on it
 page that appears, where the Next button is clicked.

11. Now you will be asked to login with the information you provided
 when creating the database:

 saldi [ Database Name ]
 Username [ SALDI administrator username ]
 Password [ SALDI administrator password ]

 You can always log in with the same information later to
 manage accounts.

12. Now the Administration menu for Balances appears. Here you choose
 "Create saldi".

13. On the "Create account" page, enter the name of the new account,
 username for an administrator with associated password.
 In addition, you must choose whether to create a standard
 chart of accounts for the new accounts. If in doubt, choose the one,
 as it suits most small businesses and it is possible
 to correct it later. Click Save/Update.

14. After some time, a message appears that the accounts are
 created and activated. Click the OK button.

15. In the Administration menu that appears, select "Show accounts" and i
 the newly created account is selected from the list.

16. Now it is time to set up the accounts in Balances. See the link
 "User guide" under "Support" on the website https://saldi.dk/
